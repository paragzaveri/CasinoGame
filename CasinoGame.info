Project: Casino Game (7.1 or 7.9)				 Levels: 4 + 1 = 5

Description:

A programming project that emulates playing video poker
at the casino.  A user will enter a wager (if they choose)
and are dealt 5 cards.  If the user would like they can
change out any or all of the 5 cards they are dealt.  The
program will print the result of the 5 cards (Royal Flush,
Straight Flush, Four of a Kind, etc).  If the user wagered,
the reward is presented after the hand is evaluated.  The 
program uses three classes for constructs, and one utility
class.  There is a class for the deck and a deck of cards 
object is constructed and used for the game.  It is shuffled
and cards are taken from the top.  There is a Card Class which
is an object for each card storing its value and suit. Finally,
there is a Hand class which is a class for the object which 
is the hand the user is dealt and modifies after rejecting
cards.  A utility class compares the final hand with
all the possible outcomes in poker and returns the outcome.
